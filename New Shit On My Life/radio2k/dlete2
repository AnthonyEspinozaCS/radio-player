Radio2k has made great progress and only a few minor things
(and one big thing) need to be added before my first major 
push to an actual domain for people to use/see the app running. 
    •play/pause/skip and audio controls need to be 
    integrated into one element for ease of use.
    •find new fonts for .currentInfo
    •change background depending on the current station
    •finalize the design of .currentInfo as well as find a good 
    place to put the "instructions" for the page where it 
    seems narutal
    •make the car gif either stop or disappear when the music is 
    paused/not playing
    •lastly (that i can think of RN) is to add the showHide to 
    somewhere that doesnt interfere with the rest of the 
    app's UI and is seamless
